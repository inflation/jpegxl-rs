/// A parallel runner implementation can be
/// provided by a JPEG XL caller to allow running computations in multiple
/// threads. This function must call the initialization function `init_func` in the
/// same thread that called it and then call the passed `run_func` once for every
/// number in the range [`start_range`, `end_range`) (including `start_range`ge but not
/// including `end_range`) possibly from different multiple threads in parallel.
///
/// The `JxlParallelRunner` function does not need to be re-entrant. This means
/// that the same `JxlParallelRunner` function with the same `runner_opaque`
/// provided parameter will not be called from the library from either `init_func` or
/// `run_func` in the same decoder or encoder instance. However, a single decoding
/// or encoding instance may call the provided `JxlParallelRunner` multiple
/// times for different parts of the decoding or encoding process.
///
/// # Returns
/// - `0`: if the @p init call succeeded (returned 0) and no other error
///     occurred in the runner code.
/// - `JXL_PARALLEL_RET_RUNNER_ERROR` if an error occurred in the runner
///     code, for example, setting up the threads.
/// - Return the return value of `init_func` if non-zero.
